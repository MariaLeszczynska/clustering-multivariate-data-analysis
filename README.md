# Hotel Customer Clustering Project

This project focuses on segmenting hotel customers using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It was developed as a group assignment for a university Multivariate Data Analysis course.

## Objective  
Identify and group similar hotel customers based on booking behavior, demographics, and spending patterns using various clustering algorithms.

## Features:
- End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA, Cleaning, Preprocessing, Clustering, Evaluation)
- Algorithms: BIRCH, GMM, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Custom preprocessing with feature engineering, outlier removal, encoding, and scaling
- Visual evaluation of clusters using PCA and other techniques
- Categorical feature treatment based on frequency thresholds
